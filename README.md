## Ecommerce-Semantic-Search
The project involves two parts the Ecommerce website and the Semantic search API

### Semantic Search API

The Semantic Search API is a Python-based API designed to provide a simple and efficient way to search for items in an ecommerce system. The API is built using the Flask web framework, which allows for quick and easy development of web applications.

#### Integration with Qdrant and Cohere

The API integrates with both the Qdrant vector database and the Cohere multilingual model to enable fast and accurate semantic searches. The Qdrant database is used to store item information as embeddings, while the Cohere model is used to convert search terms into embeddings, making it possible to search for items based on their meaning rather than just exact keywords.

#### Multilingual Capabilities

The API is also designed to be multilingual, allowing users to search for items in multiple languages. This is achieved by leveraging the multilingual capabilities of the Cohere model, which can understand and process text in a variety of languages.
